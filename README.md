# DOS-UX-CHIMERA
My personal project attempting to embed Unix stuff into DOS.



The title says it all.

I have recently got the the itch to create myself a personal hell, in the form of a painfull project.
I am also interested in somehow making a cohesive and totally-not-mindnumbing-satan-spaghetti of a project.

If I ever actually get to making this a reality, I will think of a better name.
